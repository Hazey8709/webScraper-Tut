# Branch:

**Main**: Final Project <br>
**Dev**: Development<br>


# Details:

**Use**: *NPM, Express Axios, Cheerio.*

*I choose to do a web scraper for a few reasons. I will be using Axios and Cheerio, both are a NPM package. <br>
Scraper will take information from various web sites and display them in categories on web Page. In this tutorial <br>
I will show you the code and explain whats going on. The reason I picked a webscraper was to show others that there <br>
are more possibilities then what we see or have been learning. It's possible if we try.* <br>
